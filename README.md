# Scav-it!
Learn about Balboa Park in a unique and interactive way. Using the in-game clues and the on-screen map; users can locate famous landmarks, and other popular destinations throughout the park. When a user is within the clue’s proximity; a red circle on the map, the user can snap a picture of what they think the clue is referring to. The app uses the Clarifai API to analyze the picture and return a set of keywords. If your picture matches with the clue, you’ll complete that clue and you can advance to the next clue.

## Motivation: 
We wanted to make a game that allows users to explore, learn, and become more familiar with Balboa Park.

## Technologies Used
HTML, Bootstrap, Clarifai Image Recognition API, Google Maps API, AJAX, JSON, and Firebase

## Challenges:
We had a huge challenge using github or this project. We had many merging conflicts learning to use Github as a team and collaborate on a project. By the end of the project we were able to merge changes and use github correctly without having to manually resolve conflicts as we pushed.

## Successes:
We were able to build a web based game with HTML, Bootstrap, Clarifai API, Google Maps API, firebase.

## Remaining Efforts & Improvements: 
* Additional game locations
* Allow users to upload their own clues & locations; so they can either add to the game, or make a custom game for themselves
* **Ways to monetize:** This app is a perfect tourism or crowd control app. It can be used to direct users to certain areas of the park
